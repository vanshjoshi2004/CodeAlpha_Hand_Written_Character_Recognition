Handwritten Character Recognition
Overview
The Handwritten Character Recognition project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the application of image processing and classification algorithms to solve real-world problems in digit recognition.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels and is labeled with the corresponding digit.

Features
Images: Each image is represented as a flat array of 784 pixels (28x28).
Labels: Each image has a corresponding label indicating the digit it represents (0-9).
Methodology
Data Loading:

Loaded the MNIST dataset using Scikit-Learn or a suitable library.
Data Preprocessing:

Normalized the pixel values of the images to a range of [0, 1] to improve model training.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Selection:

Chose the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.
Training and Testing:

Trained the KNN model using the training dataset.
Made predictions on the testing dataset to evaluate the model's performance.
Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Generated a confusion matrix to visualize the model's predictions against the actual labels.
Created visualizations of some test images along with their predicted labels to better understand model performance.
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy] on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report provided insights into the model's performance, indicating the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The visualizations illustrated the model's ability to accurately recognize handwritten digits.

Conclusion
The Handwritten Character Recognition project successfully demonstrates the power of machine learning and image processing techniques to recognize and classify handwritten digits. This project provides a solid foundation for further exploration in image classification, such as experimenting with more complex models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy.
